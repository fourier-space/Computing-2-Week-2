**CID**: [YOUR CID]

This is the submission template for your Computing 2 Applications coursework submission.

## Checklist
### Install dependencies locally
This template relies on a a few packages from the Node Package Manager, npm.
To install them run the following commands in the terminal.
```properties
npm install
npm install --prefix ./web-app/common
```
These won't be uploaded to your repository because of the `.gitignore`.
I'll run the same commands when I download your repos.
